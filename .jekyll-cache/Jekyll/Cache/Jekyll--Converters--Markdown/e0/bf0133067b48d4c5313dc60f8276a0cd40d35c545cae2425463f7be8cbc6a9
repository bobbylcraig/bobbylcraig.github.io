I".<p>As a developer at Mailchimp, I often find myself on the receiving end of lighthearted “code monkey” jokes from friends in the industry. While these comments are usually made in jest, they touch on a stereotype that still lingers about the role of developers. The idea that a “code monkey” simply churns out code without much thought or creativity has been around for a while. But in my experience, nothing could be further from the truth—at least not at Mailchimp, where communication, innovation, and growth are at the heart of what we do.</p>
