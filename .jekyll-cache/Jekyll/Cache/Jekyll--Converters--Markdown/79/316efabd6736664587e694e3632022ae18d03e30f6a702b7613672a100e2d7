The thought experiment, the Ship of Theseus, first intrigued me when I role-played as the fictional Lithicles of Scambonidae, a master stonemason turned aspiring tyrant, in an Ancient Greece simulation. Back then, I wielded it as rhetorical flair to justify rebuilding Athens’ walls. Decades later, the metaphor took on new weight as I watched my workplace transform under Intuit’s stewardship.</p>
