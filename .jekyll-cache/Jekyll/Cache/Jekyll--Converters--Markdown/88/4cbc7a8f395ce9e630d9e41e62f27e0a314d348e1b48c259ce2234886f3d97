I"ì<p>When <a href="https://mailchimp.com/newsroom/intuit-completes-mailchimp-acquisition/">Intuit acquired Mailchimp for $12 billion in 2021</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I found myself asking a question I hadnâ€™t revisited since college: how many pieces of a ship can you replace before itâ€™s no longer the same ship? The thought experiment, the Ship of Theseus, first intrigued me when I role-played as the fictional Lithicles of Scambonidae, a master stonemason turned aspiring tyrant, in an Ancient Greece simulation. Back then, I wielded it as rhetorical flair to justify rebuilding Athensâ€™ walls (and yes, I made <em>â€œBuild the Wallâ€ jokes</em> at the time ğŸ¤¦ğŸ»â€â™‚ï¸). Decades later, the metaphor took on new weight as I watched my workplace transform under Intuitâ€™s stewardship.</p>
